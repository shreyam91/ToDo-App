# Todo App

This is a simple Todo application that allows users to create, manage, and track their tasks. Built using **React** and **JavaScript**, the app provides a straightforward and intuitive interface for managing daily to-dos. Users can add tasks, mark them as completed, delete them, and filter tasks based on their status.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Create new tasks with a simple description.
- **Mark Tasks as Completed**: Easily mark tasks as completed with a toggle.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks that are no longer needed.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is fully responsive, ensuring a smooth experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Tech Stack

  - **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
  - **JavaScript**: Core scripting language used for app logic and interactivity.
  - **CSS**: For styling the app (custom styles or with a CSS framework like Tailwind, depending on your preference).
